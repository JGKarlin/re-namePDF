### re-namePDF.py
`renamepdf.py` is a Python script that helps you batch rename PDF files in a folder by turning their filenames into proper citations in Chicago bibliography style using the OpenAI API. You only need to provide the folder path and your OpenAI API key. The script reads the text from the first six pages of each PDF, along with the current filename, to generate accurate citations. For example, running `python renamepdf.py /path/to/folder "api_key"` will rename all PDFs in the folder, replacing their filenames with Chicago-style citations generated by GPT-4o. This makes it easier to keep your PDF filenames consistent and properly formatted for academic use.
